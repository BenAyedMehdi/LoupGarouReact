## About the game:
Loup Garou is a social game that takes place over a series of game rounds. Each round has two phases - day and night. During the day the village discusses who they think is guilty, during the night players may use special powers and the werewolves make their kill. One narrator is needed to moderate the game. 


## About the Project:
This website is replacing the narrator of the game. The solution is assigning roles to players, tell them what to do, record thir votes and decisions, and ensure the game rules are being respected. A server of the game is created, players can join with their phones. The concept is a bit similar to Kahoot or JackBox. The server-side development is ongoing.
